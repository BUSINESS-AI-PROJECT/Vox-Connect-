# Training Pipiline

This pipeline outlines the full process of preparing, training, evaluating, and deploying the machine learning model that powers Vox Connect AIâ€™s illness prediction engine.

## 1 Data cleaning  

 Goal: Ensure the dataset is clean, consistent, and usable for training.
```python  
df['symptoms'] = df['symptoms'].str.lower().str.replace('[^a-z, ]', '')
df.drop_duplicates(inplace=True)
```

---

## 2 Train-Test Split (80/20)

 Goal: Separate data for training and evaluation.
```python  
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

X = df[['symptoms', 'age', 'duration']]
y = df['diagnosis']

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, stratify=y)
```
---

## 3 Model Training
 
Goal: Fit selected algorithms to the training data.

Algorithms Used:

Logistic Regression (baseline)

Decision Tree / Random Forest (for interpretability)

Naive Bayes (for text-heavy inputs)

Steps:

Vectorize symptoms using TF-IDF or Bag-of-Words.

Normalize numeric features (age, duration).

Encode diagnosis labels.

Train multiple models and compare performance.
```python 
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
model = RandomForestClassifier()
model.fit(X_train_vectorized, y_train_encoded)
```
---
## 4 Evaluation
```python 
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, precision_score, recall_score, confusion_matrix

y_pred = model.predict(X_test_vectorized)
print("Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test_encoded, y_pred))
print("Confusion Matrix:\n", confusion_matrix(y_test_encoded, y_pred))
```
---

## 5. Export Model
```python 
import joblib
joblib.dump(model, 'models/illness_predictor.pkl')
```
