# Vox Connect AI Chat-Bot Solution

The chatbot serves as the primary interface between patients and the Vox Connect system. It replaces traditional intake staff by:

- Accepting patient input via text or voice

- Asking structured follow-up questions to clarify symptoms

- Interpreting natural language using NLP

- Triggering illness prediction and referral logic

- Providing spoken or visual guidance to the correct room or department

This makes it essential for:

- Reducing wait times

- Improving triage accuracy

- Enabling autonomous operation in clinics with limited staff

- Supporting multilingual and low-literacy populations

## Well-Planned Architecture

The chatbot is designed with modular components that reflect real-world clinic needs:

|Module	|Functionality|
|---------|------|
|NLP Engine |	Extracts symptoms and context from patient input|
|Dialogue Manager |	Guides patients through structured symptom reporting|
|Prediction Trigger	| Sends extracted data to ML model for diagnosis|
|Referral Logic |	Maps diagnosis to correct specialist and room|
|Multilingual Layer	| Supports English, isiZulu, Afrikaans (extensible)|
|Voice Integration	| Optional speech input/output for accessibility|
|Fallback Routing	| Refers to general practitioner if prediction confidence is low|
