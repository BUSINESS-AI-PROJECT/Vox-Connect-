# Solution Techniques â€” Vox Connect AI
Vox Connect AI uses a combination of supervised machine learning, natural language processing (NLP), and real-world feedback loops to deliver accurate illness predictions and patient referrals. These techniques are carefully chosen to match the constraints and goals of municipal clinics and community health centers.

## ðŸŽ¯ Techniques Used to Find the Solution

| Technique |  Purpose|
|-----------|--------------- |
|Supervised Learning	| Predict illness based on labeled symptom data|
|Natural Language Processing	| Extract symptoms from patient input in plain language|
|Feature Engineering	| Convert symptoms, age, and duration into usable model inputs|
|Model Evaluation |	Measure performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix|
|Referral | Mapping Logic	Link diagnosis to correct specialist and room|
|Time Series Analysis	| Track symptom trends and detect seasonal patterns|
|Fallback Routing |	Refer to general practitioner if prediction confidence is low|


### These techniques are directly relevant to the solution because they:

Enable autonomous triage without human supervision

Handle diverse patient input formats (spoken, typed, multilingual)

Adapt to real-world clinic workflows and constraints

Support scalable deployment across multiple locations

## ðŸ”§ How the AI Model Improves Accuracy Over Time
1  **Continuous Data Logging**

 - Every patient interaction is logged (symptoms, prediction, referral).

 - Logs are anonymized and stored locally for retraining.

2 **Periodic Retraining**

 - New data is added to the training set monthly or quarterly.

 - The model is retrained to reflect updated symptom patterns and clinic feedback.

3 **Feedback Loop**

  - Staff can flag incorrect predictions or referrals.

 - These flags are used to adjust model weights or retrain with corrected labels.

4 **Threshold Tuning**

 - Confidence thresholds are adjusted to reduce false positives or negatives.

**Example: If flu predictions are too aggressive, the threshold is raised.**

5 **Model Comparison**

 - Multiple models (e.g., Random Forest, Naive Bayes) are tested side-by-side.

 - The best-performing model is selected for deployment.

6 **Time Series Monitoring**

 - Detects shifts in symptom frequency (e.g., flu season).

 - Triggers retraining or alerting when patterns change.

7 **Multilingual Expansion**

 - NLP pipeline is updated to support new languages and dialects.

 - Improves symptom extraction accuracy for diverse populations.
