#  Model Evaluation Strategy â€” Vox Connect AI
To ensure Vox Connect AI delivers reliable illness predictions in clinical settings, the machine learning model is rigorously evaluated using standard metrics and real-world simulation. The goal is to measure how accurately the model maps patient symptoms to correct diagnoses.

### Evaluation Metrics

 |Metric	|Purpose|
 |--------|-------|
 |Accuracy	| Measures overall correctness of predictions|
 |Precision	| Measures how many predicted diagnoses were actually correct|
 |Recall	| Measures how many actual diagnoses were successfully identified|
 |F1 Score |	Balances precision and recall for a single performance score|
 |Confusion Matrix	| Visualizes correct vs incorrect predictions across all diagnosis classes|
  
### Evaluation Process

**Train-Test Split**

- Dataset is split into 80% training and 20% testing.

- Ensures the model is evaluated on unseen data.

**Model Prediction**

- The trained model predicts diagnoses for the test set.

**Metric Calculation**

- Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score are computed.

- Confusion matrix is generated to identify misclassifications.

**Threshold Tuning (Optional)**

- If using probabilistic models, thresholds can be adjusted to improve recall or precision.

 **Real-World Simulation**

- Sample patient journeys are run through the model to test usability and prediction relevance.

### Example Output

```python
Accuracy: 0.87
Precision: 0.85
Recall: 0.83
F1 Score: 0.84

Confusion Matrix:
[[45  3  2]
 [ 4 38  1]
 [ 2  1 41]]
```

_This shows strong performance across multiple diagnosis categories, with minimal misclassification._

### Deployment Safeguards

* If prediction confidence is low, Vox Connect defaults to referring the patient to a general practitioner.

* Logs are stored for periodic review and retraining.

* Future versions will include human-in-the-loop validation for high-risk cases.
