# ðŸ“ˆ Time Series Analysis â€” Vox Connect AI
## ðŸ§  Why Time Series Analysis Matters
While Vox Connect AI primarily uses supervised learning for symptom prediction, time series analysis plays a critical role in understanding patterns over time â€” especially for public health planning, model retraining, and seasonal illness trends.

###  Use Cases in Vox Connect

|Use Case|	Description|
|----------|------------|
|Symptom Frequency Over Time |	Track how often symptoms like "fever" or "cough" appear weekly/monthly|
|Diagnosis | Trends	Monitor spikes in illnesses like flu or gastroenteritis across seasons|
|Referral Volume |	Analyze how many patients are referred to each department over time|
|Model Drift Detection |	Identify when prediction accuracy drops due to changing symptom patterns|
|Clinic Load Forecasting |	Predict patient volume to optimize staffing and kiosk availability|

###  Sample Time Series Data
``` python
[
  {"date": "2025-08-01", "symptom": "fever", "count": 12},
  {"date": "2025-08-02", "symptom": "fever", "count": 15},
  {"date": "2025-08-03", "symptom": "fever", "count": 9},
  {"date": "2025-08-04", "symptom": "fever", "count": 18}
]
```

This format allows you to:

- Plot symptom trends over time

- Detect outbreaks or seasonal spikes

- Feed forecasting models (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet)

---

###  Appropriate Techniques
Technique	Purpose
- Moving Average	Smooth out daily fluctuations
- Seasonal Decomposition	Separate trend, seasonality, and noise
- ARIMA/Prophet	Forecast future symptom or diagnosis counts
- Change Point Detection	Spot sudden shifts in symptom patterns
### Why Itâ€™s Appropriate
* Clinics experience seasonal illness cycles (e.g., flu in winter).

* Vox Connect logs timestamped data, making it ideal for time series modeling.

* Helps municipalities plan resources and retrain models proactively.

* Supports epidemiological insights without needing patient identity.
