##  Model Types & Applications

| Model Type           | Application                                      |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **MLP (Multilayer Perceptron)** | Structured illness classification from numeric features |
| **CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)** | Audio signal processing for voice-based symptom input |
| **LSTM / GRU (Recurrent Neural Network)** | Sequential modeling of symptom progression over time |
| **Transformer (e.g., BERT)** | Advanced NLP for multilingual symptom extraction and context understanding |
