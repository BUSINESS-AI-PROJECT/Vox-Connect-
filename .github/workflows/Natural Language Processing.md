# Natural Language Processing, Speech Recognition or Speech Synthesis:

## Natural Language Processing (NLP)
### Relevance
- Vox Connect relies on NLP to understand patient input — whether typed or spoken.

- It extracts symptoms from natural language, even when phrased casually or in local dialects.

### Achievable Implementation
- Use libraries like spaCy, scikit-learn, or transformers for symptom extraction.

- Build a symptom vocabulary and keyword matcher.

- Add multilingual support for isiZulu, Afrikaans, and English using rule-based or fine-tuned models.

## Example
```python
input_text = "I've had a sore throat and fever for two days"
→ NLP extracts: ["sore throat", "fever"], duration: "2 days"
```

## Speech Recognition
### Relevance
- Enables patients to speak their symptoms instead of typing — crucial for accessibility.

- Useful in busy clinics or for elderly patients with limited literacy.

### Achievable Implementation
- Use SpeechRecognition with Google Speech API or Vosk (offline).

- Convert voice input to text, then pass it to the NLP engine.

## Example
```python
Patient says: "I feel dizzy and have chest pain"
→ SpeechRecognition → Text → NLP → ["dizziness", "chest pain"]
```
## Speech Synthesis
### Relevance
- Allows Vox Connect to speak back to patients — guiding them to rooms or confirming referrals.

- Supports multilingual voice output for inclusive access.

### Achievable Implementation
- Use pyttsx3 (offline) or gTTS (online) for voice output.

- Customize voice tone and language per clinic needs.

## Example
```python
Text: "Please proceed to Room 3 to see the General Practitioner"
→ Speech Synthesis → Spoken output in English or isiZulu
```
